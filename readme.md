*Esri the Nice way*

A research attempt to make file geodatabases go brrrr, assuming well-formed input data.

Focus is placed on having as few dependencies as possible, highest performance possible,
and accepting common GIS data formats/types as inputs.

No focus is placed on ensuring foreign keys are valid, domains are respected,
or that GIS data matches any spatial references used. WGS84 is assumed everywhere.
